# Statistical Cross-disciplinary Consulting & Collaboration Lab (SC3L)

The SC3L is a free service available to students, faculty, and staff at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln who are in need of assistance with a Master’s thesis, a PhD dissertation, or faculty research. The desk is staffed around 40 hours per week by advanced PhD statistics graduate students who will work with you one-on-one to design experiments, conduct power analyses, summarize data, and conduct statistical analyses.

The SC3L does not provide assistance with homework, course projects, or comprehensive exams. We also do not provide SAS installations.

Visit our UNL website [here](https://statistics.unl.edu/help-desk-form).

This book is meant to serve as a resource for our clients.
